## Find a new belonging. 

We are developers and fed up with all the recruiters and bad jobs. That's why we are now turning the tables.

## How it works:

###### 1. We dont work or search for companies. We work for developers only.

###### 2. We thoroughly investigate the companies we recommend beforehand.

###### 3. Most important for us:

- remote work
- meaningful company mission
- good error culture
- mostly async work environment
- modern tech stack
- agile development / CI / clean code and test coverage
- personal development opportunities
- compensation
- perks 

For example, the development culture is 10 times more important to us than any fruit baskets or team drinks.

###### 4. We help you to get an overview of the market and to accompany and develop you in the long term.

###### 5. We donate 10% of our profits to OpenSource projects around the world. We always welcome suggestions!
